# Welcome in Heat Control

This part of the **Adamant** project is dedicated to the refreshment of the box that will contain every part of this project.
Here will be exposed our equipment and our progress in the achievement of this part.

We'll have to run a lot of tests in order to determine the best and the greenest way to refresh the box.

If you're interested with the box I talked about, you can see it [here](<https://github.com/ZeromusSoftware/RPi3500/tree/master/box_architecture>)
